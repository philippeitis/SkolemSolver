# Euclid-Math-Problems
Right now, I've only implemented solutions for the 10th problem in the 2004 Euclid Competition - link is here:

skolem.py, for some inexplicable reason, seems to function faster than fasterskolem.py, which is likely due to 
the permutation generating function that they use. However, fasterskolem.py does use less memory than the other one.
